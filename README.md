# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project was to use CSS to layout a homepage for a bird watching website.

In order to run this project, download the files and start a local server.  The method I used was to run it through VSCode's Live Preview or through the debugger.  It should be viewable from your browser of choice.
